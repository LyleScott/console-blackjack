A console based blackjack game that is both playable and can analyze and
interface with various card counting algorithms.

I started this project to analyze blackjack gameplay using Basic Strategy and
various card counting algorithms.

To start out, I wrote a console based implementation of blackjack that a user
can manually play against an automated dealer. I used this to verify that
gameplay was correct to start the implementation and open up possibilities for
in-game analytics. Not to mention, console blackjack is neat in a nerdy way!

There are some constants you can play with in /play.py for playing in manual
mode.
