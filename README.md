================

I started this project to analyize blackjack gameplay using Basic Strategy and
various card counting algorithms.

To start out, I wrote a console based implementaton of blackjack that a user
can manually play against an automated dealer. I used this to verify that
gameplay was correct to start the implementaton and open up possibilities for
in-game analitics. Not to mention, console blackjack is neat in a nerdy way!

There are some constants you can play with in /play.py for playing in manual
mode.
