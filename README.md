About
-----

A console based blackjack game that is playable via the console (command line).

I started this project to analyze blackjack gameplay using Basic Strategy and
various card counting algorithms... as in most projects, this is still a TODO.

I did end up writing a neat console based implementation of blackjack that a
user can manually play against an automated dealer. I used this to verify that
gameplay was correct to start the implementation and open up possibilities for
in-game analytics. Not to mention, console blackjack is neat in a nerdy way!

There are some constants you can play with in /play.py for playing in manual
mode.

To Play

This uses the Python standard library, nothing more. Use Python 2.x.
